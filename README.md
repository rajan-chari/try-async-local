# AsyncLocal Demonstration Project

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK 9.0 or later
- Any code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Run the Demo (2 minutes)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AsyncLocalDemo
cd AsyncLocalDemo

# Build and run the project
dotnet build
cd src/AsyncLocalDemo.Console
dotnet run

# Run the tests (optional)
cd ../../
dotnet test
```

### What You'll See
You'll get an interactive menu to explore AsyncLocal examples:
1. **Basic Usage** - See how AsyncLocal maintains values across async operations
2. **ThreadLocal vs AsyncLocal** - Understand key differences through practical examples
3. **Logging Context** - Real-world example of correlation ID tracking

Each example provides clear, step-by-step output explaining the concepts.

### Quick Tips
- Use number keys (1-8) to navigate the menu
- Press any key after each example to return to the menu
- Each example is self-contained and can be run independently
- Check the console output for detailed explanations

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of `AsyncLocal<T>` in C#, showing how it maintains state across asynchronous control flows. The examples illustrate various use cases and compare `AsyncLocal<T>` with `ThreadLocal<T>`.

## What is AsyncLocal?

`AsyncLocal<T>` is a .NET type that provides a way to store data that flows with the async execution context. Unlike `ThreadLocal<T>` which stores data specific to a thread, `AsyncLocal<T>` maintains data across async/await boundaries, making it ideal for scenarios where context needs to be preserved across asynchronous operations.

## Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the project:
   ```
   cd src/AsyncLocalDemo.Console
   dotnet run
   ```
4. Use the interactive menu to explore different examples

## Key Concepts

### AsyncLocal vs ThreadLocal
- `ThreadLocal<T>`: Values are specific to a thread
- `AsyncLocal<T>`: Values flow with async execution context
- `AsyncLocal<T>` maintains context across thread switches in async operations

### Common Use Cases
1. **Logging Context**: Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
2. **User Context**: Maintaining user identity across async operations
3. **Request Context**: HTTP request tracking
4. **Ambient Data**: Configuration or context that should flow with async operations

### Best Practices
1. Use scoped instances where possible
2. Be cautious with value modifications
3. Consider performance implications in high-throughput scenarios
4. Use AsyncLocal for async flow scenarios, ThreadLocal for thread-specific data
